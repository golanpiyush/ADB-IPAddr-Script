5. Disconnect USB cable once wireless connection is established

### What the Script Does
1. ‚úÖ Verifies ADB installation and setup
2. üì± Checks for connected and authorized devices
3. üåê Detects your device's WiFi IP address
4. üîå Enables ADB TCP/IP mode on port 5555
5. üì° Establishes wireless connection
6. ‚úÖ Verifies the connection works

### Example Output
```
==================================================
ADB Wireless Connection Script
==================================================
[*] Checking ADB setup...

[+] ADB version: 34.0.4
[*] Checking for connected devices...
[+] Found 1 authorized device(s):
    1A2B3C4D5E6F
[*] Getting device IP address...
[+] Found IP on wlan0: 192.168.1.100
[*] Enabling TCP/IP mode on port 5555...
[+] TCP/IP mode enabled
[*] Connecting to 192.168.1.100:5555...
[+] Successfully connected to 192.168.1.100:5555
[*] Verifying wireless connection...
[+] Wireless connection verified!
    Connected: 192.168.1.100:5555

[‚úì] Setup complete! You can now disconnect the USB cable.
[‚úì] Your device is accessible at 192.168.1.100:5555

To disconnect later, use: adb disconnect
```

## Troubleshooting

### "ADB not found"
- Install ADB using the methods above
- Ensure ADB is in your system PATH
- The script checks common installation locations automatically

### "No authorized devices found"
- Connect your device via USB first
- Enable USB debugging in Developer Options
- Authorize the connection when prompted on your device
- Try a different USB cable or port

### "Failed to get IP address"
- Make sure your device is connected to WiFi
- Check that both your computer and device are on the same network
- Some devices may use different network interface names

### "Failed to connect wirelessly"
- Ensure your device and computer are on the same WiFi network
- Some corporate/public networks may block ADB connections
- Try restarting the ADB server: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`
- Check if port 5555 is blocked by firewall

## Advanced Usage

### Using Different Ports
The script uses port 5555 by default, but you can modify it in the code:
```python
connector.enable_tcpip_mode(port=5556)  # Use port 5556 instead
```

### Multiple Devices
The script will work with the first authorized device found. For multiple devices, you may need to run it separately for each device.

### Disconnecting
```bash
# Disconnect specific device
adb disconnect 192.168.1.100:5555

# Disconnect all wireless devices
adb disconnect
```
